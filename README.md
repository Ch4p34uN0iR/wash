Deprecation Notice
==================
`wash` is now deprecated and unsupported. I encourage all users to migrate to
`novahot` - the successor to `wash`, and a superior piece of software:

About
-----
`wash` is a framework for creating and interfacing with trojans that can
establish a "web shell" on a compromised web server. It is designed with
penetration testers in mind, and is thus highly versatile and extensible.
